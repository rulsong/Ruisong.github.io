# Forbes 2022 Young Billionaire Survey

**Author:** Rui Sun

## Abstract

This data visualization project primarily investigates the regional and industry distribution of billionaires under the age of 35. It also examines the proportion of billionaires in each age group. The highlight of the project is the integration of interactive maps and bar charts, which display the distribution of young billionaires in different parts of the world. Users can click on the avatars to access specific information about each young billionaire's organization, total assets, title, and birthday.
